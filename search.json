    "text": "Day 3: Ethics and Responsibility\nThe third day opened with an essential session on research ethics, led by Dr.¬†Sundararajan. Unlike the first two days, which focused on what to do in research, this session was more about what not to do‚Äîthe ethical boundaries that every responsible researcher must uphold. It explored the culture and values that distinguish a conscientious researcher, reminding us that integrity is as crucial as innovation in the research process.\nDr.¬†Srinivasan C, with deep empathy, addressed the laments of part-time researchers, offering a simple solution: attend as many sessions as possible! (near to 80% üôÇ).\nThe magic unfolded at the concluding session. Dr.¬†Shunmuga Velayutham C, in less than two hours, encapsulated the entire three-day journey. His insights, tools, and tactics were like a jetpack‚Äîthe ‚ÄúLight of lights and the innermost Self‚Äù of the workshop. His words banished the doubts that haunted the first two days. In his closing remarks, he echoed Krishna‚Äôs advice to Arjuna:\n‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§§‡•á ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•Å‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§ó‡•Å‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ | ‡§µ‡§ø‡§Æ‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§§‡§¶‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡•á‡§£ ‡§Ø‡§•‡•á‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§∏‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å || 63||\n\n(Meaning: Thus, I have explained to you this knowledge that is more secret than all secrets.
